<h2>The perfect slice-of-life anime for everyone and anyone</h2>

<section class="section">
<div class="information">
<p>Here is some information about the anime:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The anime is about how the life of a lonely young woman becomes not so 
        boring, as one fateful encounter with a dragon-girl maid changed her life forever.</li>
    <li>Mutsumi Tamura voices our main character, Miss Kobayashi</li>
    <li>Yuki Kawahara voices our second important character, Tohru, the dragon maid</li>
    <li>The director of the manga turned anime is Yasuhiro Takemoto</li>
    <li>This anime takes place in modern day Japan, and possesses two seasons currently</li>
</ul>

<div class="likes">
<p>Here are my favorite characters listed from most to least favorite (do not worry, I love every single one of them):</p>
<ol>
    <li>Kanna Kamui</li>
    <li>Miss Kobayashi</li>
    <li>Lucoa Quetzacoatl</li>
    <li>Tohru</li>
    <li>Elma Joui</li>
</ol>

<p>This anime is no doubt my absolute favorite. The art style is amazing, the music is amazing, 
    the plot, to simply put it, is amazing. It is as if the characters were designed for the viewer 
    to become connected to them. When a character is sad, the viewer is sad, when the character is 
    happy, the viewer is happy for them. The scenery along with the music is amazing, the stories 
    in each individual episode are entertaining, and it shows a sense of realism, even though three-fourths 
    of the character cast are dragons/other mythical beings. There is not only commedy, but action as well, 
    which I believe is great for those who dislike the slowness of other slice-of-life animes. This is the
    perfect anime to watch when it is rainy, when you are sad, while eating your favorite food, or all of that
    at the same time. I cannot stress this enough, I 100% recommend this anime.</p>
