<h1>A Lesson on Forms in HTML</h1>

</header>

<main>
<h2>What are forms?</h2>
<p>Forms in HTML are those areas that you type in on a website. 
    Whether it be to log in to an account or sign up search  
    something up on google, place in your card information, or completing a test,
    forms are a great tool that companies and even small businesses. 
    Welcome to Watch Mojo and today I will be discussing the Top Five
form elements needed to make visually functioning forms. (Disclaimer, 
these forms will not take in information unless a third party coding 
language, such as Javascript or Python is used.) </p>

<h2>What do Forms do?</h2>
<p>Forms are the first step in the submition process. Once a form is clicked or typed in and submitted, it becomess the job of boolean languages to maken those forms mean something.</p>

<h3>Here are the Top Five Elements for creating a Form in HTML:</h3>
<dl>
    <dt><b>1. The <code>Form</code> Element</b></dt>
        <dd>This is the basic element for starting a form in html. It is the start of the form area.</dd>

    <dt><b>2. The <code>input</code> Element</b></dt>
        <dd>This tag allows the website user to type in the designated area. From letters to words to symbols, this tag is a key element for password and log in forms.</dd>

    <dt><b>3. The <code>checkbox</code> Element</b></dt>
        <dd>This tag creates a different type of form. It allows the user to select options presented by the coder.</dd>
    
    <dt><b>4. The <code>textarea</code> Element</b></dt>
        <dd>This tag grants the user a space to type on the screen.</dd>
 
    <dt><b>5. The <code>selectarea</code> Element</b></dt>
        <dd>This tag grants the user to click a drop down menu as select an option.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There are many more elements that make many more elaborate forms, but these are the basic elements that help you get started.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>Each element possesses attributes that  change the way a form is formatted, and/or what specific function it needs to do.
</p>

<h3>Examples of Each Element's Attributes</h3>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Element</th>
        <th>Attribute</th>
        <th>Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><code>Form</code></th>
        <th><code>name</code></th>
        <th>Names the form</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><code>input</code></th>
        <th><code>type</code></th>
        <th>Allows a user a box to type in</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><code>checkbox</code></th>
        <th><code>required</code></th>
        <th>Gives a required symbol for the <br>user to know the following form is required.</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><code>textarea</code></th>
        <th><code>maxlength</code></th>
        <th>Sets the limit of how long a user can type</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th><code>selectarea</code></th>
        <th><code>size</code></th>
        <th>Sets the # of choices presented in a drop-down</th>
    </tr>

</table>

<h2>Form Examples</h2>

<p>I will now demonstrate three types of forms along with the attributes located in the previous table.</p>
