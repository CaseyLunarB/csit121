    <h1>Nigerian Goat Stew</h1>
<h2><i>A nice and cozy, melt-in-your-mouth stew for the cold seasons</i></h2>
<h3>Recipe</h3>

<h4>For this recipe, you will need:</h4>

<ul>
    <li><b>1 lb</b> <i>Goat Meat</i> (can be purchased in chopped pieces per pound.)</li>
    <li><b>3</b> <i>Tomatoes</i></li>
    <li><b>2</b> <i>Bell peppers</i> (can be any color among red, green, yellow. I prefer <b>red</b>.)</li>
    <li><b>1</b> <i>Habenero pepper</i> (can be any color plus you can add more if you prefer <br>a spicier dish, or you can skip 
        this ingredient completely if you do not prefer spice.)</li>
    <li><b>1</b> <i>Onion</i> (can be a yellow or red onion, I find red onions to have more flavor and impact.)</li>
    <li><b>1 teaspoon</b> <i>Pepper</i></li>
    <li><b>1 &frac12;</b> <i>Thyme</i></li>
    <li><b>1 teaspoon </b><i>Chicken Bouillon Powder</i></li>
    <li><b>&frac12; teaspoon </b><i>Curry Powder</i></li>
    <li><b>&frac12;</b> <i>Salt</i></li>
    <li><b>&frac14; cup</b> <i>Palm Oil</i> (can be substituted with olive oil)</li>
    <li><b>&frac12; teaspoon</b> <i>Cayenne Pepper</i> (optional if you do not prefer spice.)</li>
    <li><b>2 cups</b> <i>Beef Stock</i> or <i>Broth</i></li>
</ul>
<h4>Ok, now that you got your ingredients, let us start the process:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>Take 1 lb of goat meat and wash in a bowl of water. Remove any impurities and wash 
        until the water is clear when pouring it out.
    </li>
    <li>Place your salt, pepper, and 1 cup of beef stock or broth in the pot, and place on stovetop
    on medium heat-low heat until simmering.
    </li>
    <li>Place your goat meat in the pot and cook until the meat is tender (can pull apart
    with a fork).</li>
    <li>While your meat is cooking, wash your vegetables. I reccommend soaking them 
    in warm water with salt for 20 minutes ahead of time to get rid of impurities.</li>
    <li>Chop up your tomatoes, bell peppers, habenero pepper, and &frac12; your onion finely
         (or you can use a food processor which I heavily reccommend).</li>
    <li>Once your meat is done cooking, drain all the water and set aside. 
        You will want to use the pot you boiled your meat in to cook the stew. So place 
        the meat in another container temporarily.</li>
    <li>Place the palm oil in the pot, chop up the rest of your onion and fry the onion until translucent.</li>    
    <li>Once the onions are translucent, place the cooked goat meat in the pot and lightly fry it.</li>
    <li>Add in the puree of vegetables from step five. Cook and stir constantly. Add in your thyme, curry powder, 
        chicken bouillon powder, and cayenne pepper.</li>  
    <li>After cooking for 20 minutes, stirring, and adding seasoning to your taste, the dish is complete. 
        Serve with white rice to balance out the flavor and spice. Enjoy!</li>

<h3>About This Recipe</h3>

<p>This recipe is my favorite recipe ever, as it has given me great memories. <strong>I am not Nigerian myself</strong>, but 
    my friend's father cooked this for me, and ever since it has been my favorite African dish. The coziness is brought by the 
    stew texture and flavor that the bouillon brings. It is a perfect dish to eat while watching your favorite movie or televison 
    show.</p>
